# Salary Overlap

This tool lets two parties compare salary expectations without revealing their hard numbers.

If you reveal your salary range or expectations first, you are at a disadvantage in later salary negotiations. However, it is a waste of everyone's time if there isn't some overlap in salary expectations.

This tool lets both parties put in their salary ranges.
